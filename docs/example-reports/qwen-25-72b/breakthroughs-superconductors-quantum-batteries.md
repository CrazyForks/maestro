## 1.1. Background and Context

Recent advancements in room-temperature superconductors, quantum computing, and new battery technologies for electric vehicles (EVs) are reshaping the landscape of modern technology and industry. These breakthroughs hold the potential to significantly impact various sectors, from energy efficiency and transportation to medical imaging and computational capabilities.

The field of room-temperature superconductors has seen remarkable progress, with researchers achieving superconductivity at ambient conditions using materials like scotch-taped cleaved pyrolytic graphite and hydrides composed of hydrogen, nitrogen, and lutetium. These materials exhibit superconductivity at temperatures up to 300 K (26.85°C) and ambient pressure, a significant improvement over traditional superconductors that require temperatures near absolute zero [52][1]. Another notable material, LK-99, is claimed to superconduct at 400 K (127°C) and ambient pressure, though this claim is yet to be independently verified [17]. The discovery of these materials has the potential to revolutionize sectors such as power transmission, magnetic levitation trains, and MRI technology by eliminating the need for costly cooling mechanisms.

In the realm of quantum computing, significant strides have been made in both hardware and software development. Superconducting qubits, which are based on the coherent oscillations between two charge states in a Josephson junction, are leading the way in industrial applications. They offer high coherence times and are well-suited for large-scale integration, but they require cryogenic environments and are sensitive to environmental noise [28]. Trapped ion qubits, manipulated by lasers, provide high-fidelity qubit state preparation and detection, making them ideal for complex quantum operations, but they face challenges in scaling and maintaining stable traps [14]. Topological qubits, which are inherently stable and robust against errors, are still in the early stages of development, and the experimental confirmation of non-abelian anyons remains a critical challenge [39]. These technologies collectively aim to build more powerful and reliable quantum computers, with ongoing research focused on improving coherence times and developing effective quantum error correction techniques.

New battery technologies for electric vehicles are also advancing rapidly, offering alternatives to the widely used lithium-ion batteries. Solid-state batteries (SSBs) represent a significant step forward, with enhanced safety, higher energy density, and longer lifespans. The elimination of flammable liquid electrolytes and the use of high-capacity materials like lithium metal anodes make SSBs inherently safer and more efficient [18]. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are a cost-effective and resource-abundant alternative, with sodium constituting about 2.64 wt% of the Earth’s crust, compared to lithium’s 0.0017 wt%. SIBs are less likely to face supply constraints and geopolitical tensions, making them a more sustainable option [40]. Metal-air batteries, particularly zinc-air (ZABs) and lithium-air (LABs), offer high theoretical energy densities and cost-effectiveness, but they face significant technical challenges such as dendrite formation and sluggish kinetics of oxygen reactions at the cathode [45].

By synthesizing the latest research and developments in these areas, this report aims to provide a detailed and accessible overview for armchair experts, highlighting the transformative potential of these technologies and the ongoing efforts to bring them to practical use.

# 2. Room-Temperature Superconductors

Recent breakthroughs in the field of room-temperature superconductors have brought us closer to achieving a significant technological milestone. This section will explore the discovery and properties of these new materials, including the scotch-taped cleaved pyrolytic graphite and the hydride composed of hydrogen, nitrogen, and lutetium, as well as the claimed LK-99. We will then delve into the potential applications of room-temperature superconductors in energy transmission, transportation, and medical imaging, highlighting how these materials could revolutionize these sectors by eliminating the need for costly cooling mechanisms. Finally, we will discuss the current efforts and challenges in developing and commercializing these groundbreaking materials.

## 2.1. Discovery and Properties

Recent discoveries in the field of room-temperature superconductors have brought us closer to achieving a significant technological milestone. One of the most notable breakthroughs occurred in January 2024, when a group of researchers from Europe and South America announced they had achieved room-temperature ambient-pressure superconductivity using Scotch-taped cleaved pyrolytic graphite with surface wrinkles, which formed line defects [52]. This method observed a room-temperature superconducting state, with the results published in the journal *Advanced Quantum Technologies* and gaining considerable attention in the scientific community [52].

The material used, scotch-taped cleaved pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), exhibited one-dimensional superconductivity at temperatures up to 300 degrees Kelvin (26.85 degrees Celsius) and at ambient pressure. The defects and wrinkles in the graphite caused electrons to pair up, allowing superconductivity to occur [52]. This is a significant improvement over traditional superconductors, such as mercury, lead, and tin, which require temperatures very close to absolute zero (0 degrees Kelvin) to exhibit superconductivity [52]. High-temperature superconductors, like Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO), can superconduct at temperatures above 90 degrees Kelvin but still require cooling with liquid nitrogen [52]. The new room-temperature superconductors, if validated, would operate at much higher temperatures and under ambient pressure, eliminating the need for costly cooling mechanisms [52].

Another significant development came from Ranga Dias and his team at the University of Rochester, who announced the creation of a superconductor that operates at room temperature (21°C or 69.8°F) and near-room pressure (around 1 gigapascal) [1]. The material is a hydride composed of hydrogen, nitrogen, and the rare-earth metal lutetium. The team used a diamond anvil cell to compress a thin film of lutetium in a mixture of 99% hydrogen and 1% nitrogen at 200°C for several days, then gradually reduced the pressure while testing for superconducting properties [1]. Out of hundreds of samples, superconductivity was observed in dozens even after the pressure was lowered to about 1 gigapascal [1]. The material exhibits a drop in resistance and a peak in a property related to thermal conductivity at the critical temperature, and the team directly measured the expulsion of a magnetic field from the samples, demonstrating the Meissner effect, which is a definitive signature of superconductivity [1].

Despite these promising results, the scientific community remains cautious. The team's previous claim of a carbonaceous sulfur hydride (CSH) superconductor at 14°C and 267 gigapascals was retracted due to inconsistencies in the data [1]. Experts like Jorge Hirsch from the University of California, San Diego, and Dirk van der Marel from the University of Geneva have published claims that the raw data for the 2020 CSH study were fabricated [1]. James Hamlin from the University of Florida and Eva Zurek from the University at Buffalo, however, are highly enthusiastic and see the potential for significant impacts on various aspects of life [1].

A third notable material, LK-99, was claimed to operate at room temperature and ambient pressure [17]. LK-99 is based on a lead apatite structure with copper atoms substituted into the Pb(1) site. DFT calculations by the Shenyang National Laboratory and Sinéad Griffin at Lawrence Berkeley suggest that LK-99 has a half-filled flat band and a fully-occupied flat band around the Fermi level, which are crucial for superconductivity [17]. The Fermi level is the theoretical energy for an electron in a solid material where it has a 50% chance of occupying that energy level at any given time, acting as the "natural home" for mobile conducting electrons [17]. The presence of these flat bands, particularly the Cu-d bands, indicates strongly correlated bands, which are indicative of high-temperature superconductivity [17].

The conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory explains superconductivity in terms of Cooper pairs formed by phonon-mediated interactions between electrons [52]. The new materials, such as the scotch-taped cleaved pyrolytic graphite and LK-99, suggest a different mechanism that does not necessarily require phonon mediation. Instead, these materials use interactions with lattice vibrations to incorporate only strain fluctuations and geometrically restricted electrons, allowing superconductivity to occur at temperatures 100 times greater than those typically required by BCS theory [52][17].

While the recent breakthroughs in room-temperature superconductors are promising, they face significant skepticism and require further validation. If confirmed, these materials could revolutionize various fields, including power grids, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines, Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) trains, and neuromorphic AI computing, by providing materials that superconduct at ambient conditions [52][1]. The next section will delve into the potential applications of these room-temperature superconductors.

## 2.2. Potential Applications

Room-temperature superconductors (RTS) hold the promise of transforming several key sectors, including energy efficiency, transportation, and medical imaging. In energy transmission, RTS could drastically reduce the 7% of electricity lost to distribution by eliminating the resistance in power lines, leading to more efficient and cost-effective power delivery. This reduction in energy loss could also facilitate the unification of the world's electrical grid, enabling the widespread deployment of new power lines and enhancing the stability of renewable energy sources like wind and solar [41][23].

In transportation, the application of RTS to magnetic levitation (maglev) trains could revolutionize high-speed rail systems. Maglev trains use magnetic fields to lift and suspend vehicles above the tracks, allowing for faster and more energy-efficient operations. With room-temperature superconductors, the cost of maintaining low temperatures and high pressures would be eliminated, making maglev trains much cheaper and easier to build. This could lead to a significant expansion of maglev technology, potentially transforming mass transit systems globally [41][23][5]. Moreover, the efficiency gains from superconductors could extend to other transportation modes, including cars, planes, trains, trucks, elevators, and moving walkways, making them more efficient and environmentally friendly [41].

For medical imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the introduction of RTS could lead to more advanced and possibly more affordable imaging technologies. Traditional MRI machines require bulky and expensive cryogenic systems to maintain the low temperatures needed for superconductivity. Room-temperature superconductors could eliminate this requirement, significantly reducing the complexity and cost of MRI machines. This would make advanced imaging technology more widely available, particularly in remote or underserved areas [41][19][42]. Additionally, the use of RTS in MRI could result in higher-quality images with improved resolution and contrast, enhancing the accuracy of medical diagnoses and treatment planning. Faster scan times and more flexible machine designs, including the development of portable MRI devices, are also possible, improving patient comfort and facility workflow [19][42].

The potential for commercial and industrial applications of RTS is substantial. Power transmission and distribution systems would benefit from minimal energy losses, leading to more efficient and sustainable energy usage. High-speed trains could travel with reduced energy consumption, making them more viable and environmentally friendly. Superconducting materials could also revolutionize energy storage devices, enabling highly efficient and compact solutions for grid-scale storage and portable electronics. Quantum computing is another direct beneficiary, as room-temperature superconductors could make quantum computing more practical and accessible by eliminating the need for elaborate cooling systems, thus improving scalability and reducing costs [23][46].

However, realizing these benefits depends on the verification of the new room-temperature superconductor material and the ability to economically mass-produce it. The recent announcement by researchers at the University of Rochester of a material that is a superconductor at room temperature, albeit at high pressure, is a promising development, but further research and testing are needed to confirm its reliability and practicality [19][8]. Similarly, the claimed room-temperature superconductor LK-99, which operates at 400 K (127°C) and ambient pressure, has yet to undergo peer review and independent verification [46]. The scientific community must replicate the experiments to ensure the reproducibility and reliability of the findings, and fundamental mechanisms behind the superconductivity in these materials need further exploration.

Having examined the potential applications of room-temperature superconductors, the following section will delve into the current efforts and challenges in developing and commercializing these materials.

## 2.3. Current Efforts and Challenges

Recent efforts in the development of room-temperature superconductors have focused on validating and optimizing the materials that exhibit superconductivity at ambient conditions. Researchers have made significant strides in understanding the mechanisms behind these materials, but several challenges remain before they can be commercialized.

One of the most notable breakthroughs came from a group of researchers who achieved room-temperature superconductivity using Scotch-taped cleaved pyrolytic graphite with surface wrinkles, which formed line defects. This method observed superconductivity at temperatures up to 300 K (26.85°C) and ambient pressure, a significant improvement over traditional superconductors that require temperatures near absolute zero [52]. However, the reproducibility and consistency of this method have been questioned, and further validation is required to confirm its reliability and practicality [52].

Another significant development was reported by Ranga Dias and his team at the University of Rochester, who created a superconductor that operates at room temperature (21°C or 69.8°F) and near-room pressure (around 1 gigapascal). The material is a hydride composed of hydrogen, nitrogen, and the rare-earth metal lutetium. The team used a diamond anvil cell to compress a thin film of lutetium in a mixture of 99% hydrogen and 1% nitrogen at 200°C for several days, then gradually reduced the pressure while testing for superconducting properties. Out of hundreds of samples, superconductivity was observed in dozens even after the pressure was lowered to about 1 gigapascal. The material exhibits a drop in resistance and a peak in a property related to thermal conductivity at the critical temperature, and the team directly measured the expulsion of a magnetic field from the samples, demonstrating the Meissner effect [1]. Despite these promising results, the scientific community remains cautious. The team's previous claim of a carbonaceous sulfur hydride (CSH) superconductor at 14°C and 267 gigapascals was retracted due to inconsistencies in the data, raising concerns about the reliability of the current findings [1].

A third material, LK-99, has been claimed to superconduct at 400 K (127°C) and ambient pressure. LK-99 is based on a lead apatite structure with copper atoms substituted into the Pb(1) site. DFT calculations suggest that LK-99 has a half-filled flat band and a fully-occupied flat band around the Fermi level, which are crucial for superconductivity. The Fermi level acts as the "natural home" for mobile conducting electrons, and the presence of these flat bands, particularly the Cu-d bands, indicates strongly correlated bands, which are indicative of high-temperature superconductivity [17]. However, the claim of LK-99 as a room-temperature superconductor has not yet undergone peer review or independent verification, and the scientific community is awaiting further evidence to support these findings [17].

The conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory explains superconductivity in terms of Cooper pairs formed by phonon-mediated interactions between electrons. The new materials, such as the scotch-taped cleaved pyrolytic graphite and LK-99, suggest a different mechanism that does not necessarily require phonon mediation. Instead, these materials use interactions with lattice vibrations to incorporate only strain fluctuations and geometrically restricted electrons, allowing superconductivity to occur at temperatures 100 times greater than those typically required by BCS theory [52][17].

Despite these promising developments, several challenges must be addressed to achieve widespread commercialization of room-temperature superconductors. These include:
- **Reproducibility and Consistency:** Ensuring that the superconducting properties of these materials can be consistently reproduced in different laboratories and under varying conditions is crucial for gaining acceptance in the scientific community [1].
- **High Pressure Requirements:** While some materials, like the hydride composed of hydrogen, nitrogen, and lutetium, can superconduct at room temperature, they still require high pressures (around 1 gigapascal). Developing methods to achieve superconductivity at ambient pressure is a significant research focus [1].
- **Material Stability:** Maintaining the stability of these materials over extended periods and under various operating conditions is essential for practical applications. For example, the degradation of superconducting properties over time can limit their use in devices like MRI machines and power transmission systems [11].
- **Manufacturing Processes:** The production of room-temperature superconductors must be scalable and cost-effective. Current methods, such as the use of diamond anvil cells, are not suitable for mass production. Research into more practical and efficient manufacturing techniques is ongoing [23].

To overcome these challenges, researchers are exploring various strategies, including:
- **Advanced Characterization Techniques:** Using sophisticated methods to thoroughly characterize the materials and validate their superconducting properties. Techniques such as neutron scattering and X-ray diffraction are being employed to gain deeper insights into the atomic and electronic structures of these materials [11].
- **Material Optimization:** Focusing on the optimization of material composition and structure to enhance superconducting properties. For example, doping and alloying techniques are being investigated to improve the stability and performance of superconductors [23].
- **Pressure Reduction Methods:** Developing methods to reduce the pressure requirements for superconductivity. This includes the use of chemical pre-treatments and novel synthesis techniques that can stabilize the superconducting state at lower pressures [1].
- **Scalable Manufacturing:** Innovating in manufacturing processes to make room-temperature superconductors more practical and cost-effective. This involves the development of new fabrication techniques and the integration of renewable energy sources into the production process to reduce environmental impact [23].

Having examined the current efforts and challenges in achieving room-temperature superconductivity, the following section will delve into the broader comparative analysis of these materials, quantum computing, and new battery technologies for electric vehicles.

# 3. Quantum Computing Development

Quantum computing development is a rapidly evolving field, driven by the quest to harness the unique properties of quantum mechanics for practical computing tasks. This section will explore the current approaches to developing quantum computers, focusing on the strengths and challenges of different qubit technologies, including superconducting qubits, trapped ion qubits, and topological qubits. We will then delve into the key challenges and recent progress in quantum computing, such as improving coherence times and developing effective quantum error correction techniques. Finally, we will examine the latest advancements in quantum error correction, particularly the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the development of quantum low-density parity check codes, and the introduction of 4D geometric codes, which are essential for building fault-tolerant quantum systems.

## 3.1. Qubit Technologies

In the pursuit of practical quantum computing, various qubit technologies have emerged, each with distinct strengths and weaknesses. Among the most prominent are superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and topological qubits.

**Superconducting Qubits:**
Superconducting qubits are a dominant type in quantum computing, particularly favored by industry leaders. These qubits are based on the coherent oscillations between two charge states in a Josephson junction, which can be realized using a variety of materials and fabrication techniques. Key types include charge qubits, flux qubits, and phase qubits, each offering unique advantages. Charge qubits, for instance, were among the first to be realized and have been extensively studied, while flux qubits provide high coherence times but can be sensitive to environmental noise [28]. Phase qubits, on the other hand, exploit the phase difference across a Josephson junction, offering a different approach to quantum computation [28].

Recent advancements in superconducting qubit technology include the preparation of multi-qubit entangled states, random circuit sampling experiments, and the implementation of quantum error correction using surface codes. These achievements have been driven by improvements in qubit design and fabrication processes, such as the use of advanced CMOS-compatible techniques on 300 mm wafers, which have achieved relaxation and coherence times exceeding 100 μs [10]. However, scaling up superconducting qubits remains a significant challenge. Issues such as decoherence, control errors, and the need for cryogenic environments are major hurdles. Techniques like thermal annealing to reduce 1/f noise in Josephson junctions and minimizing kinetic inductance in tantalum-based resonators have shown promise in improving qubit performance [28].

**Trapped Ion Qubits:**
Trapped ions are considered one of the most promising systems for practical quantum computing due to their high coherence times and precise control over quantum states. These qubits are typically realized by confining ions in electromagnetic traps and manipulating their internal states using lasers or microwaves. Key performance metrics include qubit numbers, gate times and errors, native gate sets, and qubit stability [4]. Trapped ions have demonstrated high-fidelity qubit state preparation and detection, with error rates as low as \(10^{-4}\) for optical qubits and \(10^{-3}\) for hyperfine qubits [14]. This makes them suitable for complex quantum operations and error correction protocols.

However, trapped ions face challenges such as scalability and the complexity of maintaining stable ion traps over extended periods. The cooling of the vibrational modes of the ion chain to their ground state is essential for certain gate operations, but this process is very challenging. Sympathetic cooling, where a different ion species is introduced to cool the qubit ions, is a widely used technique to maintain the low temperatures required for high-fidelity quantum operations [4]. Despite these challenges, trapped-ion quantum computers have been used in various academic and industrial settings, including benchmarking studies with up to 11 qubits [4].

**Topological Qubits:**
Topological qubits are a promising type of qubit due to their enhanced stability and robustness to errors. Unlike traditional qubits, which are prone to decoherence, topological qubits distribute quantum information over a physical system, making them inherently more fault-tolerant. This is achieved through the use of Majorana zero modes (MZMs), quasiparticles that emerge from the correlated states of many interacting particles at the surface of a superconducting nanowire. MZMs are unique because they are their own antiparticles and can retain a memory of their relative positions over time. By braiding these particles—physically moving them around each other—it is possible to perform quantum operations in a way that is less susceptible to environmental disturbances [39].

Microsoft, in collaboration with UC Santa Barbara physicists, has recently unveiled an eight-qubit topological quantum processor, marking a significant breakthrough in the field. Their research, published in the journal Nature, demonstrates the creation of a topological superconductor, a new state of matter that hosts these MZMs. The team has also outlined a roadmap for scaling up their technology into a fully functional topological quantum computer, emphasizing the potential for faster and more powerful computations compared to classical supercomputers [30]. However, the experimental verification of non-abelian anyons, essential for topological quantum computing, remains a critical challenge. Some claimed evidence has been retracted or contested, and further research is needed to overcome these issues and develop practical devices [39].

**Comparison of Qubit Technologies:**
Each qubit technology has its unique set of advantages and challenges. Superconducting qubits offer high coherence times and are well-suited for large-scale integration, but they require cryogenic environments and are sensitive to environmental noise. Trapped ion qubits provide high fidelity and long coherence times, making them ideal for complex quantum operations, but they face difficulties in scaling and maintaining stable traps. Topological qubits are inherently stable and robust against errors, but their development is still in the early stages, and the experimental confirmation of non-abelian anyons is a significant hurdle.

To summarize, superconducting qubits are leading the way in industrial applications, trapped ion qubits excel in precision and reliability, and topological qubits hold the promise of fault-tolerant quantum computing. Each technology is advancing, and ongoing research aims to address the remaining challenges to make quantum computing more practical and accessible.

Having examined the strengths and weaknesses of various qubit technologies, the following section will delve into the challenges and recent progress in the development of quantum computing systems.

## 3.2. Challenges and Recent Progress

Quantum computing faces several significant challenges that must be overcome to achieve practical and reliable systems. One of the primary challenges is the issue of decoherence, where quantum information is lost due to interactions with the environment. This phenomenon is quantified by two lifetimes, \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):
- \(T_1\) measures the time it takes for the excited state (representing 1) to relax into the ground state (representing 0).
- \(T_2\) measures the dephasing time, indicating the stability of the relative phase of a superposition state.

These times impose strict limits on the duration within which calculations must be completed, making quantum processors sensitive to their environment and prone to errors [3]. Additionally, quantum hardware is subject to various sources of noise, including qubit decoherence, individual gate errors, and measurement errors, which affect the performance and reliability of quantum processors [3].

Different types of qubits, such as superconducting qubits and trapped ions, each bring unique design and engineering challenges. For example, superconducting qubits, which are among the most advanced and widely used, require extremely low temperatures to avoid decoherence. Recent advancements have led to superconducting qubits with improved coherence times, such as IBM's Heron chips, which have seen coherence times increase from 150 to 250 microseconds [9]. However, scaling up to large numbers of qubits while maintaining these coherence times remains a significant challenge [9].

Trapped ion qubits, manipulated by lasers, offer high-fidelity gates and reduced control hardware complexity. However, scaling beyond a few qubits is difficult due to the slow movement of ions, which can limit the speed of quantum operations [36]. Other qubit types, such as photonic qubits, which operate at room temperature, face issues with photon loss and maintaining fidelity, while neutral atom qubits, which use neutral atoms excited to the Rydberg state, face challenges in scaling and reducing error rates [38][36].

Quantum error correction (QEC) is a crucial technique for maintaining the integrity of quantum information. Traditional QEC schemes, such as the surface code, require a substantial overhead in terms of additional qubits. For instance, the surface code approach typically requires about 1,000 physical qubits to create one logical qubit [9]. IBM has introduced a new error-correction scheme called quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes, which can achieve the same level of error correction with only about one-tenth of the physical qubits needed by surface codes. This new architecture is designed to support qLDPC codes through increased connectivity, allowing for "non-local" interactions between qubits, which enhances efficiency [9].

Recent empirical demonstrations of quantum advantages have been based on sampling problems, such as those involving the Max Cut problem. These demonstrations show that quantum computers can outperform classical methods in certain scenarios, particularly in problems with exponential complexity [31]. For example, the Goemans-Williamson SDP-based approximation algorithm for Max Cut has been generalized to Quantum Max Cut, providing a framework for solving more complex local Hamiltonian problems [31].

Despite these advancements, significant challenges remain in developing better approximation algorithms for Quantum Max Cut and more general local Hamiltonian problems. Additionally, designing effective and practical heuristics, exploring new types of mathematical-programming hierarchies, and understanding constrained local Hamiltonian problems are important areas for future research [31].

Interdisciplinary teams, including operations researchers, are increasingly addressing optimization problems at various levels of quantum computer system design, from hardware to software. This collaboration is essential for advancing the field and overcoming the inherent challenges of building and maintaining quantum processors [31]. For instance, Microsoft has developed a family of novel four-dimensional (4D) geometric codes for QEC, which are designed to be applicable to various types of qubits, particularly those with all-to-all connectivity such as neutral atoms, ion traps, and photonics. These 4D codes offer significant improvements over existing 2D codes in terms of practical implementation and performance, achieving a fivefold reduction in the number of physical qubits needed to create each logical qubit [26].

The Physics World 2024 Breakthrough of the Year was awarded to two teams for significant advancements in QEC. The Harvard/MIT/QuEra Computing team created a quantum processor with 48 logical qubits capable of executing algorithms while correcting errors in real time, using arrays of neutral atoms (ultracold rubidium atoms trapped by optical tweezers) as physical qubits [33]. The Google Quantum AI team demonstrated QEC below the surface code threshold in a superconducting chip using Google’s Willow quantum processor, which offers up to 105 superconducting physical qubits [33]. As the number of physical qubits per logical qubit increased, the noise in the logical qubit remained below a maximum threshold, leading to exponential suppression of the logical error rate [33].

These advancements are crucial for transforming quantum computers from noisy, intermediate-scale tools into practical, problem-solving machines. The Harvard/MIT/QuEra Computing team is exploring applications in studying quantum scrambling, which could provide insights into black hole properties and quantum gravity [33]. The Google Quantum AI team’s work could lead to significant advancements in fields requiring complex computations, such as pharmaceuticals and materials science [33].

Having examined the key challenges and recent progress in quantum computing development, the following section will delve into quantum error correction techniques and their role in achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing.

## 3.3. Quantum Error Correction Techniques

Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for the development of reliable and scalable quantum computing systems. Recent advancements in QEC techniques have shown significant progress in addressing the challenges of decoherence and quantum noise, which are major obstacles in the practical implementation of quantum computers.

One of the most promising areas in QEC is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). A comprehensive review of the field highlights the superior efficiency and accuracy of AI-based methods in the QEC pipeline compared to conventional approaches [27]. Techniques such as semi-supervised learning, deep reinforcement learning, and graph neural networks have demonstrated notable improvements in error correction performance. For example, Andreasson et al. [21] showed that deep reinforcement learning can effectively correct errors in the toric code, a type of surface code, achieving significant enhancements in error correction [27]. Similarly, Wagner and Devitt [141] have optimized the error correction process using domain-specific knowledge in reinforcement learning, further improving the reliability of quantum systems [27].

Traditional QEC methods, such as surface codes, have been widely pursued for their robustness against local errors and compatibility with current hardware. However, these methods face significant limitations, including the need for a large number of physical qubits to implement logical qubits, high error rates in qubit operations, and the complexity of error detection and correction processes [50]. The distance-5 surface code, implemented on a 72-qubit Sycamore device, achieved a logical error per cycle of \((1.7 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-6}\) using a distance-25 repetition code decoded with minimum-weight perfect matching [47]. Despite this, the readout and reset of measure qubits take up most of the cycle time, leading to concurrent data qubit idling, which is a dominant source of error [47].

Another approach that has gained attention is the use of quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes. These codes offer a more efficient and scalable alternative to surface codes, requiring fewer physical qubits to achieve the same level of error correction. For instance, the gross code, a [[144,12,12]] qLDPC code, uses 144 qubits to store data and another 144 qubits to check for errors, totaling 288 qubits. This is significantly more efficient than the surface code, which would require nearly 3,000 qubits for the same task [32]. IBM has also introduced a new architecture aimed at supporting qLDPC codes, with increased connectivity allowing for "non-local" interactions between qubits, which enhances efficiency [9].

The application of machine learning in QEC has also been explored in depth. Neural network decoders and harmonized ensembles of correlated minimum-weight perfect matching decoders have been fine-tuned with processor data and optimized using reinforcement learning to adapt to device noise. These decoders can maintain below-threshold performance even when decoding in real time, with an average decoder latency of 63 μs at distance-5 over a million cycles [25]. This real-time decoding capability is crucial for meeting the strict timing requirements imposed by the fast 1.1 μs cycle duration of superconducting qubits [25].

Additionally, Microsoft researchers have introduced a new family of 4D geometric codes that promise significant improvements in fault-tolerant quantum computing. These codes use four-dimensional mathematical structures to achieve fault tolerance with fewer physical qubits, simplifying error correction and reducing overhead. The Hadamard code, for example, uses just 96 physical qubits to encode six logical qubits with a distance of eight, capable of correcting up to three errors and detecting four [15]. These codes are designed to be compatible with hardware architectures that offer all-to-all connectivity, such as neutral atom arrays, trapped ions, and photonics, making them more versatile than surface codes that are limited to two-dimensional layouts [15].

Despite these advancements, significant challenges remain in implementing QEC methods in real-world quantum computing systems. High-energy impacts can temporarily impart widespread correlated errors to the system, contributing to logical errors in higher-distance codes [25]. Device inhomogeneity makes it difficult to compare the performance of different code distances under identical noise conditions [25]. Furthermore, the presence of correlated errors, particularly from controlled-Z (CZ) gates, contributes to the error budget, making up about 17% of the total errors [25].

To address these challenges, leading companies and researchers are developing strategies such as dynamic quantum logic level reset (DQLR) to manage leakage to higher excited states of transmon qubits, which can substantially boost the performance of distance-5 codes by 35% [25]. IBM's roadmap includes several key milestones, such as the introduction of the Loon processor in 2023, which features couplers enabling connections between distant qubits on the same chip, and the development of the Kookaburra processor in 2026, which will integrate a logical processing unit and quantum memory [9]. The Cockatoo device, planned for 2027, will link two Kookaburra modules, and the Starling quantum computer, scheduled for 2028, will have 200 logical qubits and the capability to run 100 million quantum operations [9].

In summary, recent advancements in quantum error correction techniques, particularly the integration of AI and ML, the development of qLDPC codes, and the introduction of 4D geometric codes, have significantly enhanced the reliability and scalability of quantum computing systems. These techniques are crucial for building large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers that can perform complex algorithms with high fidelity. Having examined these QEC techniques, the following section will explore the latest breakthroughs in room-temperature superconductors and their potential applications.

# 4. New Battery Technologies for Electric Vehicles

New battery technologies for electric vehicles (EVs) are rapidly advancing, offering promising alternatives to traditional lithium-ion batteries. This section will explore the key features and potential applications of solid-state batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and metal-air batteries. We will begin by examining solid-state batteries, which provide enhanced safety, higher energy density, and longer lifespans, followed by sodium-ion batteries, which are cost-effective and resource-abundant, making them suitable for large-scale energy storage. Finally, we will delve into metal-air batteries, particularly lithium-air and zinc-air, which boast high theoretical energy densities and cost-effectiveness but face significant technical challenges. Each subsection will highlight the unique advantages and current obstacles of these technologies, providing a comprehensive overview of their implications for the future of EVs.

## 4.1. Solid-State Batteries

Solid-state batteries (SSBs) represent a significant advancement in energy storage technology, particularly for electric vehicles (EVs). They offer several key advantages over traditional lithium-ion batteries, including enhanced safety, higher energy density, and longer lifespans. The primary safety improvement comes from the elimination of flammable liquid electrolytes, which are a major concern in lithium-ion batteries due to the risk of thermal runaway, leakage, and flammability [18]. This makes SSBs inherently safer for applications such as EVs and portable electronics.

In terms of energy density, SSBs have the potential to achieve specific energies of ≥350 Wh/kg and energy densities of ≥900 Wh/L, which is a significant improvement over current lithium-ion batteries, which typically range from 50 to 270 Wh/kg and 80 to 650 Wh/L [21]. The use of solid electrolytes allows for the incorporation of high-capacity materials, such as lithium metal anodes, without compromising safety or stability, leading to batteries that can store more energy within a given volume or weight [18].

SSBs also exhibit longer cycle life due to the improved stability of the electrode-electrolyte interface. For example, some inorganic solid electrolytes, like garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), can form thermodynamically stable interfaces, reducing the risk of capacity loss over multiple charge-discharge cycles [18]. Additionally, SSBs can operate over a wider temperature range, from −40°C to 100°C, which enhances their versatility and performance in various environments [21].

Recent advancements in materials science have led to the development of solid electrolytes with enhanced ionic conductivity, making SSBs more feasible. Solid ceramic electrolytes, such as Li/Na 2+2x Zn 1−x GeO 4 (NASICON) and Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), have shown ionic conductivities that rival those of liquid electrolytes [18]. Polymer electrolytes, like polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), are noted for their wide electrochemical window, good thermal and chemical stability, and compatibility with lithium-metal anodes [51].

However, the commercialization of SSBs faces several challenges. Manufacturing dense, non-porous, and thin solid electrolyte films at a high yield is a non-trivial process. Laboratory-scale cells often use thick electrolyte membranes and single-side coated electrodes, which are not scalable for mass production [51]. The capital investment required to scale up SSB production is substantial, typically over 1-10 billion US dollars to reach an annual production capacity of 4-20 GWh [21]. Additionally, there is a need for clear and realistic performance testing of scaled-up prototypes, especially at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 or 6, to ensure they meet the required standards for safety and performance [51].

Despite these challenges, major automotive companies are actively investing in SSB technology. Volkswagen, in collaboration with QuantumScape, has developed a solid-state battery with higher energy density and faster charging times, aiming for a commercial launch around 2027-2028 [22]. Toyota plans to launch solid-state batteries capable of providing up to 750 miles of range and charging in just 10 minutes, also targeting a commercial release in the late 2020s [22]. Samsung SDI has received positive feedback on its solid-state battery cells, focusing on enhancing performance and reducing costs [22].

To address the high interfacial resistance in SSBs, researchers have developed various strategies. For example, Wan et al. synthesized lithophilic and lithiophobic interlayers between Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) and lithium metal, effectively suppressing lithium dendrite growth and improving cyclability [13]. Pervez et al. used LLZO to reduce interface resistance and suppress lithium dendrite growth, resulting in improved cyclability [13].

The mechanics of materials in SSBs, including the generation, prevention, and relief of stresses, are crucial for maintaining stable and efficient battery performance. Lithium metal deposition in SSBs is often nonuniform, leading to high local stresses that can cause electrolyte fracture. During electrochemical cycling, the electrodes undergo dimensional changes, which can result in the loss of contact at the interfaces, particularly at grain boundaries [2]. Proper adhesion and friction management at the interfaces are essential to prevent delamination and other mechanical failures [2].

In conclusion, while solid-state batteries offer significant advantages over traditional lithium-ion batteries, their commercialization is still hampered by manufacturing complexity, high costs, and the need for rigorous performance validation. Ongoing research and development, particularly in inorganic and composite solid electrolytes, are crucial for overcoming these challenges and achieving widespread adoption in the electric vehicle market. The next section will explore sodium-ion batteries, another promising alternative to lithium-ion technology.

## 4.2. Sodium-Ion Batteries

Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a cost-effective and resource-abundant alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), making them particularly suitable for large-scale electrical energy storage systems. Sodium, the sixth most common element in the Earth's crust, is widely available in forms like sodium chloride (common salt), which significantly reduces material costs compared to lithium. The price of sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) is approximately $150 per ton, compared to lithium carbonate (Li₂CO₃) at $5,000 per ton, highlighting the economic advantages of sodium resources [48].

### Cost-Effectiveness and Resource Availability

The abundance of sodium resources means that SIBs are less likely to face the same supply constraints and geopolitical tensions as lithium. Sodium constitutes about 2.64 wt% of the Earth’s crust, whereas lithium constitutes only about 0.0017 wt%. This significant difference in abundance translates into a more stable and cost-effective battery technology. The price of lithium carbonate is projected to grow annually by 16.7% within the next six years, which could pose a threat to the sustainability of the EV market. In contrast, SIBs do not face the same cost pressures [44].

### Performance and Technological Evolution

While SIBs may not match the energy density of LIBs, they are suitable for applications where cost and resource availability are more critical than energy density. The energy density of SIBs typically ranges from 100 to 150 Wh/kg, which is lower than the 200–260 Wh/kg of commercial LIBs. However, recent advancements have brought SIBs closer to commercial viability. For example, the Na4MnCr(PO4)3 cathode has shown a remarkably high energy density of 566.5 Wh/kg, demonstrating the potential of advanced materials in overcoming the limitations of SIBs [6].

### Key Components and Material Innovations

#### Anode Materials
Hard carbon is the most viable anode material for SIBs, offering good capacity and cycle life. It can deliver 300 mAh/g with a sloping potential profile above 0.15 V vs Na/Na⁺ and a flat potential profile below 0.15 V vs Na/Na⁺. Other anode materials, such as N,S-doped mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (NS-HCS), have shown enhanced performance, with a high reversible capacity of 321.5 mAh/g at 50 mA g⁻¹ and a capacity retention rate of 86.9% over 2,000 cycles at 1 A g⁻¹ [6]. Graphite, when co-intercalated with sodium in ether-based electrolytes, can achieve capacities around 100 mAh/g with relatively high working potentials between 0 – 1.2 V vs Na/Na⁺ [40].

#### Cathode Materials
Cathode materials significantly influence the energy density and cycle stability of SIBs. Layered transition metal oxides, such as Na₂/₃Fe₁/₂Mn₁/₂O₂, deliver high capacities of 190 mAh/g at 2.75 V vs Na/Na⁺. Polyanionic compounds, like Na₃V₂(PO₄)₃ (NVP), show excellent cycling stability and high discharge capacity, with an average discharge voltage of 3.6 V vs Na/Na⁺ [40]. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are also promising, with rhombohedral Na₂MnFe(CN)₆ displaying 150–160 mAh/g in capacity and a 3.4 V average discharge voltage [40].

#### Electrolytes
Organic liquid electrolytes are widely used in SIBs due to their low viscosity, high dielectric constant, and compatibility with common cathode and anode materials. However, these electrolytes face challenges such as low oxidation potential, high flammability, and safety hazards. To address these issues, the development of novel, low-cost, high-performance organic liquid electrolytes is essential. For instance, the use of glyme-based electrolytes with sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF₄) as the salt has been demonstrated to be non-flammable and to enhance safety [48].

### Commercial Achievements and Challenges

Several companies have made significant strides in developing and commercializing SIBs. HiNA Battery Technology Co., Ltd, a spin-off from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), has placed a 140 Wh/kg sodium-ion battery in an electric test car and obtained the first sodium-ion battery certificate from TÜV Rheinland. HiNA's batteries use Na-Fe-Mn-Cu based oxide cathodes and anthracite-based carbon anodes, with energy densities ranging from 140 to 155 Wh/kg and a cycle life of 4,500 cycles. The company aims to increase specific energy to 180-200 Wh/kg and cycle life to 8,000-10,000 cycles [40].

CATL, the world's largest lithium-ion battery manufacturer, announced the start of mass production of SIBs in 2022. In 2024, they launched the Naxtra sodium-ion battery brand with an energy density of 175 Wh/kg, approaching that of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) at 185 Wh/kg. The Naxtra battery supports 5C charging, retains 93% capacity at -30°C, and has passed rigorous safety tests [40].

Faradion Limited, a subsidiary of India's Reliance Industries, uses oxide cathodes with hard carbon anodes and liquid electrolytes. Their pouch cells have energy densities comparable to commercial Li-ion batteries (160 Wh/kg at cell-level) and demonstrate good rate performance up to 3C and cycle lives of 300 to over 1,000 cycles. Faradion's batteries have been used in e-bike and e-scooter applications [40].

### Environmental and Economic Impact

The environmental impact of sodium extraction and processing is generally less damaging compared to lithium. Sodium can be easily obtained from seawater, reducing the ecological footprint associated with mining and refining operations. The use of more environmentally benign materials in SIBs aligns with the broader goals of sustainable development and green energy technologies [24].

Economically, the development of SIBs can reduce dependency on a single type of battery chemistry and mitigate supply chain risks associated with critical materials. This is particularly important for regions and countries that lack domestic lithium resources but have abundant sodium resources. The diversification of battery technologies can stimulate economic growth by fostering new industries and job creation in battery manufacturing and related sectors [24].

### Future Directions

The future of SIBs is highly promising, driven by ongoing research and development. Key areas of focus include:
- **Overcoming Low Energy Density**: Continued advancements in material science aim to enhance the energy density of SIBs, making them more competitive with LIBs.
- **Improving Cycle Life**: Innovations in electrode materials and battery design seek to address cycle life issues, ensuring long-term stability and performance.
- **Enhancing Ion Diffusion Rates**: Research into optimizing material structures and electrolyte compositions aims to improve the speed of ion movement, which is crucial for high-performance applications.

### Conclusion

Sodium-ion batteries represent a compelling alternative to lithium-ion batteries, particularly in terms of cost, safety, and environmental impact. While they face challenges such as lower energy density and cycle life, recent advancements have brought SIBs closer to commercial viability. Leading companies like CATL, HiNA, and Faradion have made substantial strides in developing SIBs for grid storage and electric vehicles, demonstrating potential for widespread adoption in the near future. The combination of abundant raw materials, innovative cell designs, and the potential for reduced environmental impact positions SIBs as a key technology for the future of sustainable energy storage.

Having examined the potential and challenges of sodium-ion batteries, the following section will delve into metal-air batteries, another advanced battery technology with unique advantages and applications.

## 4.3. Metal-Air Batteries

Metal-air batteries (MABs) are a class of electrochemical cells that have garnered significant attention due to their high theoretical energy density and cost-effectiveness. These batteries operate by oxidizing a metal anode and reducing oxygen from the air at the cathode, forming solid metal oxides. The anode can be made from various metals, including zinc, lithium, magnesium, aluminum, and silicon, while the cathode uses ambient air, which helps in reducing the overall cost and weight of the battery [45].

Among the different types of MABs, lithium-air (LABs) and zinc-air (ZABs) stand out for their potential in electric vehicle (EV) applications. LABs have a theoretical specific energy of 5928 Wh kg−1 and an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 2.96 V, making them highly attractive for EVs due to their ability to provide longer driving ranges with lighter and more compact batteries. However, LABs face significant challenges, including the precipitation of solid discharge products (Li₂O₂) that can block cathode pores and the instability of aprotic electrolytes. Aqueous electrolytes have been proposed as a solution, but they introduce issues with carbonates formed from dissolved CO₂, which can decrease electrolyte conductivity and shorten cell lifespan [45][16].

ZABs, on the other hand, are the most developed and commercially viable MABs. They have a high theoretical energy density of 6136 Wh L−1 and a specific energy of 1218 Wh kg−1. ZABs are currently used in low-current applications like hearing aids and are being explored for larger-scale applications, including electric vehicles. The key challenges for ZABs include the formation of zinc dendrites, which can lead to short circuits, and the limited cycle life and rechargeability. Recent advancements in material design, such as the development of nanostructured manganese oxides (MnOx) and high-entropy alloys (HEAs), have shown promise in addressing these issues. For example, HEAs exhibit excellent electronic conductivity, large surface areas, and high intrinsic catalytic activity, which collectively enhance their performance and structural stability [45][29].

Magnesium-air (Mg-air) batteries also offer a high theoretical energy density of 9619 Wh L−1 and a specific energy of 5238 Wh kg−1, with an OCV of 3.090 V. Despite these advantages, Mg-air batteries face significant corrosion challenges and high self-discharge rates, which limit their practical application. Material design strategies, such as the use of platinum (Pt) as a highly effective catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), have shown some promise in improving the performance of Mg-air batteries. However, more research is needed to develop stable and efficient Mg-air systems [45][7].

Aluminum-air (Al-air) batteries have a theoretical specific energy of 5779 Wh kg−1 and an energy density of 10,347 Wh L−1. They are cost-effective and abundant, making them a viable alternative to lithium-ion batteries. However, Al-air batteries suffer from high corrosion rates in aqueous electrolytes and parasitic reactions, which can significantly degrade their performance. Recent research has focused on developing advanced electrolytes and electrode materials to mitigate these issues, with some success in improving the stability and efficiency of Al-air batteries [45][7].

Other metals, such as iron (Fe), silicon (Si), calcium (Ca), and tin (Sn), are less extensively researched but show potential for MABs. For instance, Fe-air batteries, while having a lower theoretical energy density compared to other MABs, are being explored for their low cost and environmental friendliness. Si-air batteries, which have been studied since 2009, offer a balance between energy density and cost, but their practical implementation is still in the early stages [45][7].

The operational mechanisms of MABs involve a three-phase boundary reaction (solid catalyst, liquid electrolyte, and gaseous oxygen), which is crucial for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Dual-functional catalysts are necessary to optimize both reactions, and recent advancements in this area have shown significant improvements. For example, Wang et al. synthesized N-doped cobalt oxide nanoarrays (NP-Co3O4/CC) that provided a highly effective cathode alternative, better than Pt/C + Ir/C air electrodes in terms of less overpotential, higher power density (~ 200 mW cm−2), and minimal voltage drop after 400 hours of cycling [29].

Despite the high theoretical energy densities and cost-effectiveness of MABs, their commercialization is still hindered by several technical challenges. These include inferior rate capability, dendrite formation, corrosion during electrochemical reactions, and sluggish kinetics of oxygen reactions at the cathode. Start-ups like Eos Energy Storage and Fluidic Energy are working on commercializing ZABs for stationary storage applications, but further advancements in electrolyte stability and reversibility are required to make LABs commercially viable [45][7].

To overcome these challenges, ongoing research is focused on developing new materials and catalysts, optimizing cell design, and enhancing the stability of the anode and electrolyte. For instance, the use of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) and nanostructured arrays has shown promise in improving the performance and longevity of MABs. Additionally, the development of metal-air flow technologies, such as vanadium-air flow batteries (VAFBs), offers high design flexibility, safety, and long operational life, making them suitable for large-scale energy storage and stationary power plants [45][7].

In conclusion, while metal-air batteries, particularly LABs and ZABs, offer high energy density and cost-effectiveness, significant challenges remain in their commercialization. Ongoing research in material design and cell engineering is crucial for addressing these issues and making MABs a viable alternative to lithium-ion batteries in the electric vehicle market. The next section will explore the environmental and cost comparisons of these advanced battery technologies.

## 4.4. Environmental and Cost Comparisons

When comparing the environmental impacts and cost factors of solid-state, sodium-ion, and metal-air batteries with traditional lithium-ion batteries, several key points emerge. Solid-state batteries (SSBs) offer significant advantages in terms of safety and energy density, but their environmental impact is generally higher due to the manufacturing processes and the use of specific materials. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are more cost-effective and environmentally friendly, particularly in scenarios where the electricity mix is cleaner. Metal-air batteries (MABs), such as zinc-air and lithium-air, show promise in terms of energy density and cost, but they face significant technical challenges that limit their practical implementation.

**Environmental Impact:**

- **Solid-State Batteries (SSBs):**
  - SSBs generally exhibit higher environmental impacts compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in most footprint indicators, particularly when the functional unit is 1 kg. Key areas contributing to this higher impact include the manufacturing of solid electrolytes, which require significant energy and resources, and the use of critical materials like lanthanum, lithium, and zirconium [51]. A study by Smith et al. (2021) found that the carbon footprint and water footprint of SSBs are higher due to the energy-intensive processes involved in stirring and high heating. However, increasing the cycle life of SSBs to 2800 cycles can reduce their environmental impact below that of LIBs [51].
  - **Water Usage and Land Use:** The extraction and processing of raw materials for SSBs, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, lanthanum, and cerium, can lead to significant habitat destruction and water contamination. Mining activities for these materials often occur in ecologically sensitive areas, disrupting local ecosystems and contributing to deforestation and carbon dioxide emissions [12].
  - **Biodiversity Impact:** The mining of materials for SSBs can result in a decrease in biodiversity due to habitat destruction and pollution [12].

- **Sodium-Ion Batteries (SIBs):**
  - SIBs generally have lower environmental impacts and carbon emissions compared to LIBs. The extraction and processing of sodium are less environmentally damaging, and the widespread availability of sodium reduces the ecological footprint associated with mining and refining operations [40]. A study by Ellingsen et al. (2014) found that the carbon emission value of NCM batteries is almost double that of SIBs when the functional unit is 1 kg [43]. Additionally, the use of more environmentally benign materials in SIBs aligns with the broader goals of sustainable development and green energy technologies [24].
  - **Water Usage and Land Use:** Sodium can be easily obtained from seawater, reducing the pressure for low-cost recycling and the need for extensive land use for mining operations [24].
  - **Biodiversity Impact:** The extraction and processing of sodium are generally less harmful to local ecosystems, leading to a lower impact on biodiversity [24].

- **Metal-Air Batteries (MABs):**
  - MABs, particularly zinc-air batteries (ZABs), offer low environmental impact due to their high capacity, low cost, and enhanced safety. However, the production of N-doped cobalt oxides, a promising cathode material for ZABs, involves high temperatures and hazardous chemicals, leading to environmental pollution and structural breakdown issues [29]. Despite these challenges, ZABs are considered more sustainable compared to LIBs, especially in terms of their ability to recover and reuse metal oxide by-products [29].
  - **Water Usage and Land Use:** The production of ZABs involves less water usage and land use compared to LIBs, as zinc is more abundant and less energy-intensive to extract [29].
  - **Biodiversity Impact:** The mining of zinc is less likely to disrupt local ecosystems, leading to a lower impact on biodiversity [29].

**Cost Factors:**

- **Solid-State Batteries (SSBs):**
  - The manufacturing processes of SSBs, particularly those involving high-temperature steps and the use of specific materials like lithium, lanthanum, and zirconia, can be more resource-intensive and thus potentially more expensive [51]. The cost of SSBs is influenced by the energy demand in clean drying rooms and cathode slurry preparation, which are energy-intensive processes. Innovations such as lower-temperature synthesis methods and the integration of renewable energy into manufacturing facilities could help reduce these costs [12].
  - **Material Costs:** Lanthanum, lithium, and zirconium are crucial materials in SSBs, with zirconium having a particularly high share (over 40%) in the raw material composition. Monitoring the use of these materials and considering alternatives or minimizing their usage is essential for reducing production costs and environmental impact [12].

- **Sodium-Ion Batteries (SIBs):**
  - SIBs are economically advantageous due to the abundant and low-cost nature of sodium resources. Sodium is the sixth most common element in the Earth's crust and is widely available from sources like seawater and salt deposits, which reduces material costs [40]. The cost of producing SIBs is predicted to be 25-30% lower than that of LIBs, primarily due to the abundance of sodium and the use of less expensive materials like iron and manganese instead of cobalt and nickel [43]. However, the lower energy density of SIBs means that more material is required to achieve the same energy storage, which can increase overall costs [40].
  - **Labor Costs:** The complexity of SIB manufacturing, including high-temperature sintering processes for solid electrolytes and precise assembly conditions, increases labor costs [12].
  - **Energy Costs:** The production of SIBs is inherently energy-intensive, particularly due to the high-temperature sintering processes required for solid electrolytes. Innovations such as lower-temperature synthesis methods and the integration of renewable energy into manufacturing facilities could help reduce these costs [12].

- **Metal-Air Batteries (MABs):**
  - MABs, such as zinc-air and lithium-air batteries, are cost-effective due to the abundance of their constituent metals. Zinc is more abundant and widely distributed in the Earth’s crust, making it a more sustainable and cost-effective option compared to lithium [29]. The cost of ZABs is influenced by the price of minerals, which can vary significantly. For example, the spot price of lithium in 2024 averages $10,000–15,000 per tonne, which is a result of oversupply due to a slump in EV sales in the latter half of 2023 [34]. The cost of MABs is also affected by the need for advanced materials and catalysts, such as high-entropy alloys (HEAs) and nanostructured arrays, which are crucial for improving performance and longevity [29].
  - **Recycling Costs:** The recycling of MABs, particularly ZABs, can be more cost-effective due to the ability to recover and reuse metal oxide by-products, although the environmental impact of their production and disposal needs further investigation [29].

**Comparative Analysis:**

- **Carbon Footprint:**
  - The carbon footprint of SSBs is higher compared to LIBs, primarily due to the energy-intensive manufacturing processes and the use of specific materials like lanthanum and zirconium [51]. In contrast, SIBs have a lower carbon footprint, especially in scenarios where the electricity mix is cleaner [43]. MABs, particularly ZABs, exhibit a lower carbon footprint due to the use of abundant and less toxic materials [29].

- **Water Footprint:**
  - The water footprint of SSBs is higher compared to LIBs, mainly due to the high energy demand in the manufacturing process [51]. SIBs, on the other hand, have a lower water footprint because sodium can be easily obtained from seawater, reducing the pressure for low-cost recycling [24]. MABs, particularly ZABs, also have a lower water footprint, but the production of N-doped cobalt oxides can introduce challenges [29].

- **Material Footprint:**
  - The material footprint of SSBs is higher due to the use of critical materials like lanthanum, lithium, and zirconium, which are energy-intensive to extract and process [51]. SIBs have a lower material footprint, as sodium is more abundant and less expensive, and the use of non-critical materials like iron and manganese further reduces the environmental impact [40]. MABs, particularly ZABs, have a lower material footprint due to the use of abundant and less toxic materials [29].

- **Recycling and End-of-Life Disposal:**
  - The recycling and end-of-life disposal processes for SSBs are more challenging and resource-intensive compared to LIBs, which have a more mature recycling infrastructure [51]. SIBs, with their use of abundant and less toxic materials, may simplify recycling processes, although detailed methods are not extensively covered in the literature [40]. MABs, particularly ZABs, have a more sustainable lifecycle, with the ability to recover and reuse metal oxide by-products, but the environmental impact of their production and disposal needs further investigation [29].

**Conclusion:**

While solid-state batteries offer significant advantages in terms of safety and energy density, their environmental impact is generally higher due to the manufacturing processes and the use of specific materials. Sodium-ion batteries are more cost-effective and environmentally friendly, particularly in scenarios with a cleaner electricity mix. Metal-air batteries, such as zinc-air and lithium-air, show promise in terms of energy density and cost, but they face significant technical challenges that need to be addressed. Ongoing research and development in material science, electrolyte stability, and recycling methods are crucial for overcoming these challenges and making these advanced battery technologies viable alternatives to traditional lithium-ion batteries in the electric vehicle market.

Having examined the environmental and cost comparisons of these advanced battery technologies, the following section will delve into the broader comparative analysis of their performance and potential applications.

# 5. Comparative Analysis

The intersection of room-temperature superconductors, quantum computing, and new battery technologies represents a frontier of innovation with profound implications for various sectors. Each of these technologies is advancing rapidly, driven by breakthroughs in materials science, engineering, and theoretical models. Below, we synthesize the key advancements, potential impacts, and future prospects of these technologies.

**Room-Temperature Superconductors:**
Recent discoveries in high-temperature superconductivity have primarily focused on hydrogen-rich materials, which exhibit superconductivity at significantly higher temperatures compared to traditional superconductors. For instance, hydrogen sulphide (H3S) was found to have a critical temperature (Tc) of 203 K when compressed to megabar pressures [35]. Even higher pressures of around 350 to 400 GPa are required to achieve room-temperature superconductivity, with materials such as MgH6, LaH18, and CeH18 predicted to exhibit this property under these conditions [35]. The practical implications of achieving room-temperature superconductivity are vast. In MRI technology, room-temperature superconductors like LK-99 could eliminate the need for liquid helium cooling, making MRI units smaller, lighter, and more affordable [11]. This would lead to improved image resolution and faster scanning times, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. In energy transmission, room-temperature superconductors could drastically reduce the 7% of electricity lost to distribution, leading to more efficient and cost-effective power delivery [41]. Additionally, they could facilitate the unification of the world's electrical grid and enhance the stability of renewable energy sources like wind and solar [41].

**Quantum Computing Development:**
Quantum computing is advancing through the development of various qubit technologies, each with unique strengths and challenges. Superconducting qubits, which operate at extremely low temperatures to avoid decoherence, are a leading technology in the field. Recent advancements include the preparation of multi-qubit entangled states and the implementation of quantum error correction using surface codes [8]. IBM has announced a 433-qubit processor and plans to launch a 1000-qubit processor, while Google aims for a 1000-qubit processor by 2025 and a one-million-qubit, error-corrected quantum computer within the next decade [8]. Trapped ion qubits, manipulated by lasers, offer high-fidelity gates and reduced control hardware complexity but face difficulties in scaling beyond a few qubits [36]. Photonic qubits, which operate at room temperature, are being explored for their practicality and accessibility, but they face issues with photon loss and maintaining fidelity [37]. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in quantum error correction (QEC) has shown significant promise, with techniques like semi-supervised learning and deep reinforcement learning enhancing error correction performance [20]. Traditional QEC methods, such as surface codes, require a substantial overhead in terms of physical qubits, but newer approaches like quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes and 4D geometric codes offer more efficient and scalable alternatives [15][9].

**New Battery Technologies for Electric Vehicles:**
Emerging battery technologies beyond lithium-ion are poised to challenge the status quo, offering enhanced performance, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. Solid-state batteries (SSBs) represent a significant advancement, with higher energy density and improved safety due to the elimination of flammable liquid electrolytes [18]. SSBs can achieve specific energies of ≥350 Wh/kg and energy densities of ≥900 Wh/L, which is a significant improvement over current lithium-ion batteries [21]. However, the manufacturing processes of SSBs are more resource-intensive, leading to higher environmental impacts [51]. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are a cost-effective and resource-abundant alternative, with sodium constituting about 2.64 wt% of the Earth’s crust, compared to lithium’s 0.0017 wt% [40]. SIBs have a lower energy density (100 to 150 Wh/kg) but are more sustainable and less prone to environmental damage during extraction and processing [24]. Metal-air batteries (MABs), such as zinc-air (ZABs) and lithium-air (LABs), offer high theoretical energy densities and cost-effectiveness. ZABs, in particular, have a high theoretical energy density of 6136 Wh L−1 and a specific energy of 1218 Wh kg−1, making them suitable for large-scale energy storage and electric vehicles [45]. However, MABs face significant technical challenges, including inferior rate capability, dendrite formation, and sluggish kinetics of oxygen reactions at the cathode [29].

| **Solid-State Batteries** | ≥350 Wh/kg, ≥900 Wh/L | High (due to manufacturing complexity) | High (initially, but can be reduced with longer cycle life) | Electric vehicles, grid storage [18][51] |
| **Sodium-Ion Batteries** | 100 to 150 Wh/kg | Low (due to abundant sodium) | Low (due to less toxic materials) | Grid storage, electric vehicles [40][24] |
| **Metal-Air Batteries** | 6136 Wh L−1 for ZABs, 5928 Wh kg−1 for LABs | Low (due to abundant metals) | Low (due to sustainable lifecycle) | Large-scale energy storage, electric vehicles [45][29] |
