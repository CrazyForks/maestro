# Prompts Used for Example Reports

These are the actual prompts given to all models to generate the example reports.

## 1. Behavior-Elastic Pricing (Neuromarketing)

```
If we replace price-elastic demand curves with "behavior-elastic" curves derived from 
neuro-marketing data, how does optimal pricing change?
```

**Style instruction:** "I want the report to be written in magazine style for semi-technical readers, but I want you to keep all the technical details in there as much as possible."

## 2. Road Trip Itinerary (DC to Bar Harbor to Boston)

```
Can you help me plan a 2 week road trip from Washington, DC, to Bar Harbor Maine, 
and ending in Boston, MA? Suggest an interesting route that should include beautiful 
little towns and amazing hiking. I would like to know the best food options and 
must see/do things along the way
```

**Style instruction:** "I want a day-by-day itinerary, and write it in pompous prose addressing me as royalty."

## 3. Satellite Night-Light as Economic Indicator

```
Can satellite-derived night-light intensity serve as a leading indicator for 
regional consumer-spending shifts?
```

## 4. Digital Workplace Surveillance

```
How do digital workplace surveillance technologies reshape power dynamics, 
psychological contracts, and employee performance in remote and hybrid work settings, 
and what governance frameworks can balance organizational monitoring needs with 
individual privacy and autonomy?
```

**Style instruction:** "I want this in HBR style."

## 5. Technology Breakthroughs (Multi-Topic)

```
Write a detailed report that examines all the following questions:

What are the latest breakthroughs in room-temperature superconductors, and which 
research groups are closest to achieving practical applications?

How are different countries approaching quantum computing development, and what are 
the current technical bottlenecks preventing widespread quantum supremacy?

What new battery technologies beyond lithium-ion are showing promise for electric 
vehicles, and what are their respective advantages and manufacturing challenges?
```

**Style instruction:** "These are for a popsci magazine with an armchair expert readership. Keep it detailed and give me separate essay for each topic."

## 6. Business Analytics Curriculum with GenAI

```
Help me design a curriculum for business analytics course that focuses on generative AI 
and its business applications. The course is for graduate business students who are not 
necessarily programmers but have basic python. The course is intended to be delivered 
over the course of a regular 16 week semester with practical exercises and assignments. 
Ideally the course should also have a project that allows the students to apply some of 
the things that they have done and learned and showcase their creativity and knowledge.
```

## 7. AI Deception Detection Under Cognitive Load

```
Are AI models trained to detect deception (via micro-expressions) more accurate when 
users are under cognitive load (e.g., stress, fatigue)?
```

## Additional Prompts (Variations)

Some reports used variations or additional context-specific prompts:

### Nostalgia in Consumer Behavior
```
Analyze how nostalgia affects consumer purchasing decisions during economic uncertainty. 
Include psychological frameworks and practical marketing applications.
```

### Universal Basic Income Analysis
```
Examine the cultural factors affecting Universal Basic Income implementation and its 
impact on entrepreneurship across different societies. Include case studies from 
Nordic countries, Kenya, and Alaska.
```

### Algorithmic Decision Systems
```
Examine how algorithmic decision-making systems perpetuate or mitigate social inequality 
across healthcare, criminal justice, and education sectors. Include international case 
studies and regulatory frameworks.
```

### AI in Academic Research
```
Compare traditional machine learning tools with generative AI approaches in academic 
research. Focus on methodology, effectiveness, and ethical considerations.
```

### Temporal Analytics for Organizations
```
Analyze how temporal analytics can enhance organizational agility in turbulent markets. 
Include strategic frameworks and implementation roadmaps.
```

**Note:** All models received the same prompts. The variations in output demonstrate each model's unique interpretation and capabilities when given identical instructions.
